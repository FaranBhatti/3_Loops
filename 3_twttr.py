File name:                   3_twttr.py
Description:                 When texting or tweeting, it's not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting
                             vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In this file, we will implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and outputs that same text but with all the vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in lowercase or uppercase.
